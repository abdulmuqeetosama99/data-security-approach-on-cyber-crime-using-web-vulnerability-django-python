<h3 style="color:blue"> Title : Data Security approach on Cyber Crime with Web Vulnerbility </h3>
<h3 style="color:blue"> Abstract: </h3>
<p> Internet (Web) is a significant wellspring of spreading terrorism through addresses, speeches, videos and recordings. Terrorist associations use web particularly informal communities(social networks ) to indoctrinate people and furthermore advance psychological militant exercises through provocative pages that rouse defenseless
individuals to join psychological oppressor(terrorist) associations.
So here we propose an efficient web data mining system to detect such
web properties and flag them automatically for human review.
Web pages are comprised of HTML HTML (Hypertext markup language).</p>
<p> In different game plans and have pictures, writings and so forth., intermixed
on a solitary website page. Here, we utilized Data mining just as web mining
to recognize examples and mine out printed data on site pages.</p>
<p>Here, we are utilizing E-mail System to identify the undesirable messages
that are progressively helpless to terrorism and will send to the spam
legitimately to the beneficiary who is utilizing the framework.</p>

<h3 style="color:blue">Conclusion:</h3>
<p>To curb and destroy the terrorism and spreading of their activities through online social media through unwanted messages and images to cover the helpless people, we need to use the powerful method or system. That system should be useful to the cops for easily give awareness to common people and find the person who are spreading the harmful words as well as who are all involved in terrorism.
</p>
<p>
This Project Work addressed the Program Outcomes (POs): PO1, PO2, PO3, PO4, PO5, PO6, PO7, PO8, PO9, PO10, PO11, PO12 and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs): PSO1, POS2 & POS3.These Program Outcomes (POs) and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) are attained by demonstrating the working model of the project.
</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Future Work: </h3>
<p>
These Web Application can also be integrated into various other application where people can send messages to other people so that person who are spreading the harmful words as well as involved in terrorism can be detected not only in email but also in other social media platforms like whatâ€™s app, telegram, etc.
</p>
<p>
To track the encrypted mails and documents should be tracked by system. If required any undesirable content found in the document need to be forwarded directly to the admin as alert message with the sender details. And tracking and tracing of Digital Evidence against the culprit for illegal activities.
